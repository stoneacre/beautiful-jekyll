## Did You Know? 

Many dream of being financially stable, owning a home, and enjoying time with family. The harsh reality is that over 50% of Latinos residing in the United States do not own a home [[1]](http://hispanicwealthproject.org/shhr/2015-SHHR-FINAL-FF.pdf), and among this same population, over 50% do not have a sufficient bank account [[2]](https://www.fdic.gov/householdsurvey/2015/2015execsumm.pdf). The same population was less successful than other populations when answering basic financial literacy questions [[3]](https://www.fdic.gov/householdsurvey/2015/2015execsumm.pdf).  With proper financial education, all Latinos can achieve their financial dreams.

#### Carlos Astrada, Tech Entrepreneur

Carlos Astrada, a first-generation American, saw the predatory lending practices and lack of financial inclusion that plagued the Latino community in the United States first-hand. Despite meteoric growth in population as well as political and economic clout, the Latino community continues to be underserved.  Much more needs to be done. As a tech entrepreneur, Carlos and his team built Super Monedero with the goal to be the premiere financial education and inclusion platform for the US Latino Community.
